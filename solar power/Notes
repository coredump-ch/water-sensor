(From Danilo via Telegram): we lose about 0.21% from the battery per measurement with the 2G Electron.

The battery holds a charge of about 2000mAh.  So each measurement consumes about 15.5 mWh of energy (3.7V * 2000mAh * 0.0021).

The smallest solar panel I have, which fits nicely in the top of the jar, provides ~10 mW in overcast conditions.

So we can very roughly guess the panel could recharge one measurement's worth of energy in something like 1.5 hours in overcast conditions.

Haven't managed to get good characterization of the panel in the jar in sunny conditions, but the above suggests we should be ok to do 4-6 measurements per day.  Even with no sunny days, ~8 hours of overcast might be enough to recover all the spent energy.
